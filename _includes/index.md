In developing the idea Policy Innovation Lab, significant work went into research around the Lab itself. Treating the Lab as connective tissue between policy students, the community, experts, and anchor institutions involved development of best practices, foundational documents around autonomy and organizational direction, and identifying what the Lab *is* and, as important, what the Lab *is not*.

In the spirit of contributing to our communities, we now provide the fruits of the research under a [Creative Commons BY-SA license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/): the documentation that went into the Policy Innovation Lab, and a playbook for spinning up a Lab - fork [the-canon](https://github.com/GUPolicyInnovationLab/the-canon), fill your information, and get to work. Our hope is that our work done at Georgetown will be adapted by public policy schools around the country, so other communities can be empowered to solve big issues with big ideas.
